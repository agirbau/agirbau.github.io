Hello! I'm Andreu Girbau Xalabarder, a Post-Doctoral research fellow at [Satoh-lab](http://www.satoh-lab.nii.ac.jp/) at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, 
and my interests are in Event Cameras, Computer Vision and applied Machine Learning in general. 
I did my PhD at [AutomaticTV\|Mediapro](https://www.automatic.tv) 
in collaboration with the [Polytechnic University of Catalonia](https://telecos.upc.edu/en) in Barcelona with the [Image Processing Group](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/). 
Feel free to contact me for collaboration!
